This agent should first see if there's enough information in the db to answer the questions.
Otherwise the agent searches the university website for information and uses the retrieved information to
answer the question.

(free search tools
 https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ddg
 https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/search_tools --> you need to set up your own search engine

 )
workflow
if the question is about troubleshooting the agent should look for information in the DB
if the question is about the university, the agent should look for information on the website
Before the agent looks for information in the website, the agent needs to generate a query

Todo the agent should try the web search three tines with different queries. If the agent can't find the information should ask the user for more information
